# Recursive Agent Orchestration
Just a simple architecture that spawns and manages LLM-driven agents via a master-delegator model, with task-specific prompt tuning, execution constraints, and multi-agent recursion.

## Here's how it works
![architecture diagram](/assets/architecture.png)

When an input is given to the `Master/Orchestrator agent`, the agent first generates a list of tasks that has to be done to achieve it. This dynamically creating customized agents with custom prompts on the fly that's fine-tuned and generated by the `Master agent` and creates `Child agents`. These child agents can do the specialized work, if it needs more specialized works then it can create `Sub-children agents`. These return a expected object as output.

## Why Golang
Mostly because of goroutines and parallel agent processing when needed. This is to make it fast to respond compared to **single-threaded** layers.

Introduces systems where a root agent "decomposes tasks into subtasks then delegates to sub-agents" rather than using human-defined agent graphs.

Implements "sub-agents created with specialized capabilities for token efficiency and parallel processing" through dynamic task analysis.
